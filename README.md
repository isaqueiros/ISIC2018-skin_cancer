# ISIC2018
This repo refers to the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2018 challenge for diagnosis of skin cancer through dermoscopic images.<br>
The data and further information on the ISIC challenge can be found through the link <a href="https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018/">ISIC Archive - Challenges</a>.<br>

## Task 3
Classification of skin lesion across 7 categories: MEL (melanoma), NV (melanocytic nevus), BCC (basal cell carcinoma), AKIEC (actinic keratosis / Bowenâ€™s disease), BKL (benign keratosis), DF (dermatofibroma), and VASC (vascular lesion).<br>
The goal of the classification is to provide specific information and treatment options for a lesion, and detect skin cancer with a reasonable sensitivity and specificity.<br>
Task 3 of the challenge provided 10,015 images as training dataset for the model. Those are available in the page <a href="https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018">ISIC Archive - Data</a>.<br><br>
For this task, the following files have been created:
